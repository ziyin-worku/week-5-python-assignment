# Python OOP Assignment

## Description
This assignment demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python, including **classes, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**. 

It contains two activities:

### Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class inheriting from a `Device` parent class.
- Includes attributes like `brand`, `model`, `storage`, and a private `battery`.
- Methods include:
  - `device_info()` (overridden for polymorphism)
  - `charge()` to increase battery
  - `use()` to decrease battery
- Demonstrates **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**.

### Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Created a `Vehicle` class with subclasses: `Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`.
- Each subclass defines its own version of the `move()` method.
- Demonstrates **polymorphism**, as the same method name behaves differently for each object.

## How to Run
1. Save the Python file (e.g., `assignment.py`).
2. Run the file using Python:
   ```bash
   python assignment.py
